# ### Problem 5
# Create a SportsTeam Class for tracking sports teams. The class should have the properties team_name_p, team_city, and team_ranking_p.
# The class should have a method to change a Teamâ€™s ranking. 
# The class should implement the ```__str__``` method so that when an instance of the SportsTeam is printed it will output a string containing the team name, team city, and team rank (use f strings to format the output).
# Your program should create a SportsTeam instance with an initial ranking of 2.
# Print out the class.
# Your program should change the ranking of the team to 8 using only the class method.
# Print out the class (should use your ```__str__``` method).


# Example Output:
# ```
# The Grizzlies are from Memphis and are 2 in the standings.
# # Update the rating from 2 to 8 from your code
# The Grizzlies are from Memphis and are 8 in the standings.
# ```
class SportsTeam:
    def __init__(self,team_name,team_city,team_ranking):
        self.team_name = team_name
        self.team_city = team_city
        self.team_ranking = team_ranking
    def changeRanking(self,newRanking):
        self.team_ranking = newRanking

    def __str__(self):
        return f"The {self.team_name} are from {self.team_city} and are {self.team_ranking} in standings"

# Your program should create a SportsTeam instance with an initial ranking of 2.
newTeam = SportsTeam('Lakers','Los Angelas',2)
print(newTeam)

# Your program should change the ranking of the team to 8 using only the class method.
# Print out the class (should use your ```__str__``` method).
newTeam.changeRanking(8)
